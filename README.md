title: "Prodigy InfoTech Internship — Task 1: Data Visualization"
intro: >
  Welcome to my Prodigy InfoTech Data Science Internship repository!
  This repository contains **Task 1**, which focuses on visually analyzing dataset distributions
  using bar charts and histograms to uncover meaningful insights.

task_overview: >
  The objective of this task is to **create visualizations** such as bar charts and histograms
  to analyze the distribution of population values across different countries.
  This task uses the **World Bank Global Population Dataset**, which stores total population data
  for countries from 1960 to 2023.

what_i_learned:
  - Working with real-world datasets and metadata formatting
  - Cleaning and preprocessing datasets using `skiprows` to manage structured CSV formats
  - Creating **histograms and bar charts** to explore feature distributions
  - Understanding **population variation across countries**
  - Extracting insights and presenting them visually

key_insights:
  - >
    Countries like **India, China, and the United States** hold the highest population levels globally.
  - >
    The distribution of population is highly **right-skewed**, indicating that only a few countries
    dominate global population share.
  - >
    Many smaller nations show comparatively lower population values.
  - >
    Visualizations help clearly differentiate trends and provide a better understanding of global variation.
