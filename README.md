# Prodigy InfoTech Internship — Task 1: Data Visualization
Welcome to my Prodigy InfoTech Data Science Internship repository!  
This repository contains Task 1, which focuses on visually analyzing dataset distributions using charts and graphs to uncover meaningful insights.

---

## 📌 Task Overview
The objective of this task is to create bar charts and histograms to analyze the distribution of population values across different countries.
For this task, I used the World Bank Global Population Dataset, which contains total population data recorded annually from 1960 to 2023.

## 🧠 What I Learned
This project helped me gain valuable experience in:
- Working with **real-world datasets and handling metadata formatting**
- Cleaning and preprocessing population datasets using **skiprows**
- Creating **histograms & bar charts** to explore numerical and comparative patterns
- Understanding **global population variation across countries**
- Extracting **insights and presenting findings visually**

## 🔧 Technologies & Libraries Used
- **Python**
- **Google Colab**
- **Pandas, NumPy**
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn**

---

## 📊 Key Insights
- **India, China, and the United States** have the largest population totals globally.
- The distribution of population values is highly **right-skewed**, with only a few countries dominating global population share.
- Many smaller nations have significantly lower population sizes in comparison.
- Visual charts clearly highlight differences and trends that may not be apparent in raw numerical tables.
