description: "Task 1 of Prodigy InfoTech internship focusing on visualizing data distribution using bar charts and histograms."
internship: "Prodigy InfoTech - Data Science Internship"
task_number: 1
task_name: "Data Visualization - Distribution Analysis"

objective: >
  Create bar charts and histograms to visualize the distribution of categorical
  and continuous variables. The dataset used is the World Bank Global Population Dataset,
  containing population statistics of countries across multiple decades.

dataset:
  name: "World Bank Global Population Dataset"
  file: "API_SP.POP.TOTL_DS2_en_csv_v2.csv"
  source: "https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL"
  description: >
    Contains total population values for each country from 1960 to 2023,
    along with country identifiers and related metadata.

learned:
  - Handling real-world structured datasets
  - Cleaning and preprocessing World Bank CSV metadata using skiprows
  - Using Python libraries for statistical visualization
  - Generating histograms and bar charts to interpret trends
  - Identifying patterns and comparing country-level population values

technologies:
  - Python
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn
  - Google Colab

insights:
  - "India, China, and the United States have the largest populations globally."
  - "Population distribution is heavily right-skewed due to a few high-population countries."
  - "Many countries have comparatively small populations."
  - "Bar charts and histograms effectively highlight global population differences."
